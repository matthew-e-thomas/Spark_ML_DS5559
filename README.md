# Spark_ML_DS5559
Machine learning project with PySpark for UVa Data Science Big Data Class

We are using the Lending Club dataset on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

Our goal is to use PySpark to clean the data and use the ML library to do feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and compare various machine learning algorithms to try to predict whether a borrower will default on their loan or not.
